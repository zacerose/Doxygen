# Doxygen

The Employee subclass and the Officer and Supervisor superclasses showcase inheritence in C++.  
Futhermore, Doxygen showcases a form of auto-generated documentation.

## Required Files
* main.cpp --> The driver file, used to demonstrate the functionality of the classes and prints output in the console
* Employee.cpp --> The file containing the Employee class implementation
* Employee.h --> The header file containing all the function prototypes for the Employee class
* Officer.cpp --> The file containing the Officer class implementation
* Officer.h --> The header file containing all the function prototypes for the Officer class
* Supervisor.cpp --> The file containing the Supervisor class implementation
* Supervisor.h --> The header file containing all the function prototypes for the Supervisor class
* doxyConfig --> doxygen config file
* html --> folder containing the doxygen documentation for this source code
* latex --> folder containing files for doxygen to use

## Compilation instructions

If a recompile is needed, compile all .cpp files together with g++
To regenerate the documentation, use "doxygen doxyConfig ." from within the folder containing the source code

## Program usage.

To launch the program, run the binary generated by the compiler, by default "./a.out"  
To read the documenation, open the html folder and open "index.html" in a suitable browser
